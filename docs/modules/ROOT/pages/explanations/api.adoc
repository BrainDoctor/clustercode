= API

== Enabling the REST API

If you enable the API, you can navigate to `your.host:8080/static/swagger.html` and retrieve the API documentation.
You can also get `/static/swagger.json` and upload it to https://editor.swagger.io[Swagger] to generate a client in your preferred programming language.
It's quite awesome!
