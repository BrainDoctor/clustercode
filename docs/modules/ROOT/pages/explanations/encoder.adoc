== CLI

Currently, only `+ffmpeg+` is supported.
It needs to be installed on the system, though it is included in the Docker image.

== IO Redirection

When `+ffmpeg+` is invoked, by default the output is not displayed in the console of the clustercode process.
You can enable it to debug problems with a profile or video file, however, the REST API will not be able to get the progress information.

== Default file format

This is the *file* extension of converted files.
Be aware that you need to specify the *container* format in the profiles.
An `+.mkv+` file extension does not make it playable if there's `+mp4+` in it.
